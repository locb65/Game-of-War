Game-of-War

# Welcome to my Game of War!

## This is a javascript only take on a classic card game that never ends from our childhood. The game basics is to completely deal out a deck of playing cards to all players. The game is played with the deck faced down and each player flips the first card of the deck. The larger card wins all cards flip. If there is a tie, then whoever tied goes to War. In war, 3 cards are played faced down and the 4th card is flipped. The largest 4th card takes with War winnings. Play continues until one person acquires all the cards.
