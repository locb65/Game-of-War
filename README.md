Game-of-War

# Welcome to my Game of War!

## This is a javascript only take on a classic card game that never ends from our childhood. 

### The game basics: 
#### Completely deal out a deck of playing cards to all players. 
#### Dealt deck is placed faced down 
#### Each round every player flips the first card of the deck and the largest flipped card wins all cards played that round. 
#### If there is a tie, then whoever ties goes to War. In war, 3 cards are played faced down and the 4th card is flipped. The largest 4th card takes with War winnings. 

### Play continues until one person acquires all the cards!
